This website was designed to test the knowledge of the fans of Lord of the Rings! Beginning with a start page which continues onto the quiz on the next page, which contains a timer counting down from 30 seconds and a score total at the end of the questions. The quiz page also has a slide show of pictures, Lord of the Ring themed.

The Home page shows a Welcome note and a button to 'Begin quiz'. The second page includes a heading and then a box containing the question and a list of multiple-choice questions with radio style buttons. On the top of the quiz box there is a timer counting down, adding a bit more pressure to answer questions!

This website is the second of five projects that needs to be completed in order to receve a diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.

Requirements for the project is that the website has to be static and responsive using HTML 5, CSS3 and Javasript.
