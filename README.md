<img width="1421" alt="Screenshot 2022-07-03 at 07 59 43" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101525431/177034439-f7dcc7a2-944b-422c-a71a-7ad06aa023a2.png">

This website was designed to test the knowledge of the fans of Lord of the Rings! Beginning with a start page which continues onto the quiz on the next page, which contains a timer counting down from 30 seconds and a score total at the end of the questions. The quiz page also has a slide show of pictures, Lord of the Ring themed.

The Home page shows a Welcome note and a button to 'Begin quiz'. The second page includes a heading and then a box containing the question and a list of multiple-choice questions with radio style buttons. On the top of the quiz box there is a timer counting down, adding a bit more pressure to answer questions!

This website is the second of five projects that needs to be completed in order to receve a diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.

Requirements for the project is that the website has to be static and responsive using HTML 5, CSS3 and Javasript.

A live version of the site can be found here:

## UX 

## User Demographic
 This site has been designed for users of all ages and all fans of the great book and movie series, to test their knowledge and see if they really know the beloved series!
 
 ## User Goals
 * To have some fun and learn something new about The Lord of the Rings!
 * To have fans test their knowledge.
 * To see some photos set the theme for the quiz.
 
 ## Design 
The design has been inspired by a tutorial demonstration I came across: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYIMygIcU 
The aim for this website is to create a clean looking website with an appealing colour scheme, my colours were chosen to go with the book and fanstasy themed quiz.
This website is two pages, links to each page are on both pages. The index.html contains a button stating 'Begin Quiz', which when pressed brings you to the quiz page: quiz.html. The second link is under the header on the quiz page stating 'Go Back', which brings you back to the Welcome note on the Home page.

## Colour Scheme
The colour scheme I chose because dark shades of green and grey remind me of the theme of the website.
The colours I chose were:
- The Welcome note has this colour: #404040, which is a soft dark grey.
- The Begin quiz button has a dark green colour, and once hovered over it turns a dark slate grey.
- The Quiz page has the colour black for the headings and questions and a black shadow on the borders.
- The 'Go Back' button is a darkgreen colour and turns a dark grey colour once it's hovered over.
- The quiz-box is this colour: rgb(182, 201, 182), which is an easy on the eyes pastel green colour. The box also has an opacity filter on it, so you can fully see the slide-show of images while you're taking the quiz.
- The submit button is an antiquewhite colour and goes beige once it's hovered over. The text is a darkgreen colour.

## Typography 
- The fonts used for this project were from https://fonts.google.com/
- Icons for the leaves in the header are from https://fontawesome.com/
- The fonts used for the Welcome note are: 'Bilbo', cursive;
- The fonts used for the Quiz page: 'MedievalSharp', cursive;

## Images 
Images have been chosen in accordance to colour and content. The purpose of the website is to give a friendly look and express quality. Images have been sized in order to match design and consistency.
The slide-show of images is the result of a javascript function and source links to the images.
